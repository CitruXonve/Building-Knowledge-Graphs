When the oral examination has been passed, the student is formally admitted to candidacy.", "When the student is admitted to candidacy, a dissertation committee is established consisting of three members of the qualifying exam committee, one of whom must be from outside the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The dissertation committee has the responsibility of providing consultation in research, approving the dissertation, conducting the final oral examination and recommending the candidate for the PhD degree. The doctoral dissertation should make a contribution to knowledge and theory related to the profession of social work. Dissertations must not only show technical mastery of the subject and research methodology but must also demonstrate the candidate's ability to work independently as a scholar.", "The first step in the dissertation process is the development of a dissertation proposal. Normally about 25-30 pages, the proposal should contain a clear statement of purpose, a rationale for the research, research questions or hypotheses, a review of pertinent literature, and an explication of the research methods to be used including the design, instrumentation, sampling procedures and plan for analysis. The proposal must include human subject clearances for the anticipated research obtained from the appropriate school and university committees.", "The dissertation proposal is submitted to the student's dissertation committee and defended. Upon approval of the proposal, a copy is filed with the director of the doctoral program.", "It is expected that students will begin work on their dissertation prospectus as soon as possible after completion of the qualifying examinations, and that an acceptable proposal will be presented within three months of the completion of the examination.", "Since the abstract of the dissertation is also published in Dissertation Abstracts International, it should be written with care and must be representative of the final draft of the dissertation. A shorter abstract for publication in Social Work Research and Abstracts is also required.", "Upon approval of the final draft of the dissertation by all members of the dissertation committee, the candidate must pass a general final oral examination. After the candidate successfully completes the final oral examination, the committee recommends the candidate to the Graduate School for the PhD degree."] }] },

However all cancers relate to uncontrolled cell proliferation with many cancers having a strong genetic predisposition. Consequently, major features of this program include the breadth of medically related interests and training and faculty characterized by wide and varied skills in many cancer-related research areas. To facilitate the application of multidisciplinary approaches to make cancer a disease of the past, close and regular contact between participating faculty of different disciplines and students is a major theme of this PhD program.", "course": null },

Arranged by four topical streams \u2013 problem solving, leadership, dispositions of leaders and reflection \u2013 the program seeks to attract a diverse student body of current and emerging leaders who are interested in fostering learning that leads to systemic improvement in their workplaces. The primary emphasis will be on those individuals who currently hold or are seeking leadership positions within colleges/universities, traditional and non-traditional K-12 environments, chief learning officers and their related human resources staff, non-profits and governmental organizations. The degree is not linked to the credentials typically needed to become an administrator in a K-12 environment, including becoming a principal or superintendent. The degree requires a minimum of 60 units. Students with a prior master's may enter with Advanced Standing, reducing their units to 43.
