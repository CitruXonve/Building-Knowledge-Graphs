The courses in this minor are grouped in order to give students a foundational understanding of the cultural roots and representations of identity, the practice of storytelling in the context of local and disenfranchised communities, as well as various institutional structures and policies that create barriers or avenues of social justice. Familiarity with these important issues serves students on a practical level by improving their ability to understand, anticipate and appreciate diverse viewpoints and audiences. The minor also helps students develop as more engaged, informed and empathetic citizens who are empowered to bring resolution and shared understanding to areas of conflict and difference in their own lives, the broader community and the workplace.

Students will analyze the interrelationships of folklore and national, regional and ethnic identities.
